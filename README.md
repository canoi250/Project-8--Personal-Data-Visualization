# Project 8 Personal Data Visualization

# Part 1: Extracting timestamps from your personal data
Import at least one of your personal data files into a Jupyter notebook.

Parse the data into a dataframe.

Extract just the timestamps into a new dataframe.

Export that new dataframe as a .csv file.

# Part 2: Analyzing timestamp data for patterns

Import your partner's timestamp data into a Jupyter notebook. Using Python and pandas, complete the following:

Answer: What is the longest time between timestamps? What is the average time between timestamps?

Answer: What is the day with the most timestamps? How many events (timestamps) were on that day? 

Answer: What is the month with the most timestamps? How many events (timestamps) were on that month? 

Answer: What do you think the source of this data is? Write a few sentences explaining your reasoning. What other data might help you verify if you are correct?
Exchange your analysis with your partner. Read your partner's analysis -- does it seem accurate? Did they guess the correct data source (or type of data source)?

# Part 3: Make a combined visualization
Using both partners' timestamp data, make a visualization that shows the distribution of events over time for both people. For this part, use Python and Jupyter notebook, plus matplotlib/pyplot or Seaborn.

# Part 4: Analyze and visualize an additional element from  your personal data
The analysis includes:

At least two clear questions that you ask and then answer via data analysis

At least one form of data manipulation (calculating new values, doing a groupby, etc.)

At least one visualization (you can use any tool you like: Observable, Seaborn, Flourish, etc.)

For this portion of the project, do not include your code or your raw data -- that is personal and you can keep it private! You just need to include your results (i.e. findings from your analysis) and your visualization.
